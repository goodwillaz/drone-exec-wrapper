# Drone Exec Wrapper

Wrapper scripts for calling Drone Exec so that it can more closely emulate what Drone does.

### Prerequisites

Install the drone cli first

### Installing

Copy the appropriate script to a folder on your PATH so you can call it.  You can rename it as you see fit as long as it's not named drone.  For example, rename drone-exec-linux to just drone-exec.
